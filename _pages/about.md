I am a PhD student at the [University of Technology, Graz (Austria)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) and the [Know Center Research GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/en/) under supervision of [Andreas Tr√ºgler](https://atruegler.at/). 

My research focuses on differential privacy, which is widely regarded as the state-of-the-art for protecting privacy in data analysis and machine learning. I am especially interested in the trade-offs and synergies that arise between various requirements for trustworthy AI (in particular privacy and fairness), as well as the practical and societal implications of integrating differential privacy into real-world systems.
