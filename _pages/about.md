I am a PhD student at the [University of Technology, Graz (Austria)](https://www.tugraz.at/en/home/) and the [Know Center Research GmbH](https://www.know-center.at/en/) under supervision of [Andreas Tr√ºgler](https://atruegler.at/). My research revolves around trustworthy AI, with a focus on differential privacy and fairness. 
I am particularly interested in trade-offs and synergies that arise between various requirements for trustworthy AI, as well as the practical and societal implications of integrating differential privacy into real-world systems.

In addition to my PhD research, I am interested in the science of science and environmental research. Outside of academia, I am passionate about road cycling, singing, and motorcycle travel.
